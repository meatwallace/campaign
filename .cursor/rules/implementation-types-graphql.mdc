      GraphQL Types Standards:

      1. GraphQL Types:
         - Generated by GraphQL Codegen
         - Run `yarn codegen:graphql` to generate
         - Located in generated directories per configuration
         - Never manually edit or commit these files
         - Must run codegen to access GraphQL types

      2. Development Workflow:
         - Run `yarn codegen:graphql` for schema changes
         - Reference generated types in components and services
         - Re-run generation after schema changes

      3. Error Resolution:
         - Missing GraphQL types: Run `yarn codegen:graphql`
         - Type mismatches: Update schema first
         - Never create manual type definitions for GraphQL types

examples:
  - input: |
      ```tsx
      // ❌ WRONG: Creating manual GraphQL types
      type UserQuery = {
        // ...manual type definition
      };

      // ✅ CORRECT: Using generated GraphQL types
      import { type GetUserQuery } from '~/gql/graphql';
      ```
