      Version Control Standards:

      1. Branch Naming:
         - Use prefixes: 
           - `feature/` - New features or significant enhancements
           - `fix/` - Bug fixes
           - `chore/` - Maintenance, refactoring, or tooling
         - Include issue number after prefix: `feature/#52-add-user-auth`
         - Use kebab-case for descriptions
         - Keep branch names concise but descriptive

      2. Commit Messages:
         Format: `type(#issue): description`
         
         Types:
         - `feat`: New feature or enhancement
         - `fix`: Bug fix
         - `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies
         - `docs`: Documentation changes
         - `test`: Test-related changes
         - `refactor`: Code refactoring
         
         Guidelines:
         - Use present tense ("add" not "added")
         - First line should be complete sentence
         - Reference GitHub issue number
         - Keep description under 72 characters
         - Add detailed description if needed

      3. Pull Requests:
         - Link related issues using GitHub keywords
         - Include clear description of changes
         - Keep changes focused and atomic
         - Update PR description with relevant info

      4. Git Practices:
         - Rebase feature branches on main
         - Squash commits before merging
         - Keep linear history when possible
         - No merge commits on feature branches
         - Write meaningful commit messages

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad - no prefix or issue number
      branch: add-auth
      commit: added auth stuff and fixed tests

      // Bad - wrong format
      branch: feature/auth-stuff
      commit: [FIX] auth bug #123

      // Bad - multiple concerns
      commit: feat(#52): add auth and fix tests and update docs

      // Good - branch naming
      branch: feature/#52-add-user-auth
      branch: fix/#64-resolve-auth-state
      branch: chore/#45-update-dependencies

      // Good - commit messages
      commit: feat(#52): add JWT-based user authentication
      commit: fix(#64): resolve undefined user state in auth flow
      commit: docs(#75): update authentication API documentation
      commit: test(#80): add integration tests for auth flow
      commit: chore(#45): update dependency versions
    output: "Version control following standards"
