      Route Types Standards:

      1. Route Types (+types):
         - Generated automatically when running the dev server
         - Located in `+types` directories next to route files
         - Generated when running `yarn dev:app-web`
         - Never manually edit or commit these files
         - Must run dev server to access route types

      2. Development Workflow:
         - Start dev server with `yarn dev:app-web` to generate route types
         - Reference generated types in components
         - Re-run dev server after route changes

      3. Error Resolution:
         - Missing route types: Start dev server with `yarn dev:app-web`
         - Type mismatches: Update route implementation first
         - Never create manual type definitions for route types

examples:
  - input: |
      ```tsx
      // ❌ WRONG: Creating manual route types
      // file: routes/+types/profile.ts
      export type Route = {
        ComponentProps: {
          // ...manual types
        }
      };

      // ✅ CORRECT: Using generated route types
      import { type Route } from './+types/routes';
      
      export function Profile(props: Route.ComponentProps) {
        // ...
      }
      ```
