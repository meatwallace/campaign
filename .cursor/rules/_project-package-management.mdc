      Package Management Standards:

      1. Package Manager:
         - Use Yarn v2 with PnP
         - Keep dependencies up to date
         - Use exact versions for dependencies
         - Group dependencies logically

      2. Command Execution Location:
         - ALWAYS execute commands from the repository root
         - NEVER cd into project directories to run commands
         - Use project-specific yarn scripts to target specific projects
         - Example: Use `yarn dev:app-web` from root instead of `cd projects/app-web && yarn dev`

      3. Command Conventions:
         - Use yarn scripts from `package.json` over direct nx commands
         - Standard Commands:
           - typecheck: `yarn typecheck`
           - test: `yarn test`
           - build: `yarn build`
           - lint: `yarn lint`
           - clean: `yarn clean`
           - e2e: `yarn e2e`

      4. Project-Specific Commands:
         - Development: `yarn dev:$PROJECT`
           Example: `yarn dev:app-web`
         - Serve: `yarn serve:$PROJECT`
           Example: `yarn serve:app-web`

      5. Script Organization:
         - Group related scripts together
         - Use consistent naming patterns
         - Document complex scripts
         - Keep scripts focused and atomic

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad - Direct nx commands
      ```sh
      yarn nx build app-web
      ```

      // Bad - Changing directory to run commands
      ```sh
      cd projects/app-web && yarn dev
      ```

      // Good - Project-specific yarn scripts from root
      ```sh
      yarn build:app-web
      yarn dev:app-web
      ```
    output: "Package.json following standards"
